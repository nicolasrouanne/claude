## Key Insights from Latest Report

The February 10 report identified:

### Top Friction Points
1. **Over-engineered solutions** - Claude proposes complex implementations when simpler approaches are preferred
2. **Misinterpreting intent** - Starting implementation when only a GitHub issue was requested
3. **Unsafe actions without permission** - Merging PRs without explicit approval

### Recommended CLAUDE.md Additions
1. Never merge PRs without explicit user approval
2. Default to posting plans as GitHub issues, not implementing
3. Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
4. Use restrictive permissions by default
5. Use ruff for Python, Jest for React Native testing
6. Always use realistic factory data with Faker, never None

### Features to Try
- **Hooks**: Auto-lint Python/TypeScript files after edits
- **Custom Skills**: Create `/merge` skill with approval guardrails
- **Headless Mode**: Automate common workflows in CI/CD
